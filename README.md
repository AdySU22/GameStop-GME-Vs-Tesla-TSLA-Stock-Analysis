# Stock Price and Revenue Analysis: TSLA vs GME

Understanding the dynamics of stock prices is multifaceted. It involves various factors such as the number of shares available, future profit projections, and more. A key indicator is the company's profitability and profit growth; as profits rise, stock prices generally follow suit. If you anticipate an increase in a company's profits, it's wise to invest in the stock, expecting the price to climb. But what if you predict a drop in the stock price?

This is where short selling comes into play. By borrowing shares, selling them, and then buying them back at a lower price to return to the lender, investors can profit from a stockâ€™s decline. Stocks tend to drop faster than they climb, allowing for quick profits. Experienced investors, such as hedge funds, often engage in short selling. However, if the stock price rises, the potential for losses is significant.

There are instances where short sellers miscalculate, as seen with Tesla. Several years ago, many short sellers bet against Tesla. However, as Tesla's profitability increased, so did its stock price, driven by solid company performance. This sustained rise in stock price challenged short sellers.

In contrast, some stocks experience price hikes not grounded in fundamentals. An example is GameStop, where individual investors from the Reddit community "WallStreetBets" bought shares of the struggling video game retailer, causing its stock price to soar. This surge resulted in substantial losses for hedge funds that had shorted the stock. Despite these fluctuations, GameStop's share price is expected to eventually drop, encouraging hedge funds to maintain their short positions.

As a data scientist at a hedge fund, my task is to extract profit data for Tesla and GameStop, and build a dashboard to analyze and compare stock prices versus profits.
